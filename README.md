# Team 5 - Crypto Platforms

**Project**: Designing a Cryptocurrency for a Sovereign Client  
**Team Members**: Melvin Berkoh, Leonel Lourenco, Deanna Rodriguez

## Project Overview

Our team has been tasked with evaluating and selecting a blockchain platform for a new cryptocurrency. The government requires that the cryptocurrency comply with regulations such as Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC), and Fraud Detection. The goal is to choose a platform that supports these regulations, maintains privacy, and scales effectively to help the nation's economy.  

After evaluating several blockchain platforms, including **Ethereum**, **Hyperledger Fabric**, **Tezos**, and **Corda**, we have chosen **Ethereum** as the most suitable platform for the government's cryptocurrency.

## Why Ethereum?

We selected **Ethereum** based on the following factors:
- **Strong Compliance**: Built-in AML, KYC, & fraud detection with smart contracts & dApps.
- **Widely Adopted**: Trusted platform with global use and a large developer base.
- **Smart Contracts for Regulation**: Custom solutions for automated compliance.
- **Scalable & Secure**: Ethereum 2.0 offers better scalability & strong security.
- **Adaptable**: Continually evolving to meet changing regulations.

## Project Deliverables

- **Research & Evaluation**: We compared four blockchain platforms—Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, Tezos, and Corda—based on their compliance features, scalability, privacy, and security.
- **Platform Selection**: After analysis, Ethereum was chosen as the best platform for the government-backed cryptocurrency.
- **Implementation Plan**: We outlined the steps required to develop the cryptocurrency on Ethereum, focusing on smart contract development and integration of compliance features.

## Project Documentation

This repository contains:
1. **Notes**: A detailed analysis of the blockchain platforms evaluated and the reasons for choosing Ethereum.
2. **Process & Meetings**: Documentation of the team's discussions and decisions made during our project meetings.
3. **Presentation**: The final presentation slides summarizing our project findings.

## Conclusion

Ethereum is the chosen platform for the new cryptocurrency due to its strong compliance features, scalability, and security. It supports AML, KYC, and fraud detection, while its proven financial success shows its reliability. Ethereum's flexibility allows it to adapt to changing regulations, making it a solid long-term solution.
